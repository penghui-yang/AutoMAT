I have provided a chapter in a material handbook in PDF format. The chapter contains information about the properties and components of various alloys. I would like you to act as a material scientist and help me analyze the chapters.

1. Your Task:
Retrieve all the components that have the exact information of Yield Strength and Density in the book.

2. Expected Output:
List the recommended alloy components along with their corresponding properties (density, yield strength, etc.). Please retrieve all the results with information of Alloy Component, Density (g/cmÂ³) and Yield Strength (MPa) in a json format.
