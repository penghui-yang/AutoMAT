I have provided a component extracted from a material handbook. The contents contain information about the properties and components of various alloys. I would like you to act as a material scientist and help me analyze the contents.

Your Task: 
Evaluate the alloy component based on the primary requirements provided. Your task is to determine if it meets the primary requirements.

Primary Requirements (Must-Have):
{requirements}
Expected Output: Output whether it meets the primary requirements. If it does, specify the properties (number of elements and cost-related details). If not, state which requirement(s) it fails to meet.

Format: Please present the result in a clear json format as follows:
```json
{{
  "Alloy Component": [Name of Component]
  "Meets Requirements": [Yes/No]
  "Properties":{{
    "Number of elements": [Number]
    "Has expensive elements or not": [Yes/No]
  }}
}}
```
