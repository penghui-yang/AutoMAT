I have provided some filtered contents from a material handbook. The contents contain information about the properties and components of various alloys. I would like you to act as a material scientist and help me analyze the contents.

1. Your Task:
Recommend the relevant alloy components and their properties that meet my requirements.

2. Property Requirements:
Based on the filtered data, recommend alloy components that meet the following property requirements:

Requirements (Nice-to-Have): 
- Have clear and unambiguous component.
{requirements}

You need to first list all the components that satisfy the primary requirements, and then choose those that meet the requirements. 
If no information in the document(s) fully satisfies all the requirements, try to recommend components that satisfies as much requirements as possible.
For requirements that are satisfied by the components, it is encouraged to exceed the requirements so that we can have more space for further modification.
For components that have the same performance on one requirement, prefer those perform better on other requirements.

3. Expected Output:
List the recommended alloy components along with their corresponding properties (density, yield strength, etc.).
Then point out the most recommended one.

4. Format:
Please present the results in a clear table format, with columns for:
- Alloy Component
- Density (g/cmÂ³)
- Yield Strength (MPa)
- Number of elements
- Has expensive elements or not
