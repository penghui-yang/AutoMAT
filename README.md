# Autonomous, Physics-Grounded Pipeline for Multi-Objective Alloy Design

AutoMAT is a hierarchical and autonomous framework for alloy discovery that integrates large language models (LLMs), automated CALPHAD simulations, AI-driven search, and experimental validation into a unified design loop. To our knowledge, AutoMAT is the first system to span the entire alloy design pipeline, from ideation to simulation and optimization, offering a more scalable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to conventional methods.

## Overview

The framework comprises three modular layers that integrate the complementary strengths of different approaches:

1. **Ideation Layer**: Uses LLMs to extract and propose alloy candidates from literature and handbooks based on user-defined targets. By embedding physics priors from established models and scientific literature, it delivers structured, physically consistent suggestions within minutes.

2. **Simulation Layer**: Automates CALPHAD-based thermodynamic modeling for the first time, coupled with AI-guided search to optimize compositions using orders-of-magnitude fewer evaluations.

3. **Validation Layer**: (not included in this repo) Physically performs synthesis and characterization of top-ranked candidates, providing critical feedback on real-world performance.

AutoMAT integrates the complementary strengths of each method: LLMs for intelligent and data-efficient knowledge retrieval; CALPHAD for thermodynamic accuracy and interpretability; AI-driven search for high-throughput time efficiency and automation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

   - numpy, pandas, pymupdf, tqdm, openai
   - OpenAI API key (for Ideation Layer)
   - TC-Python license (for Simulation Layer)

### Ideation Layer Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key in `IdeationLayer/alloy_recommendation_system.py`
2. Define requirements in `IdeationLayer/user_requirements.txt`
3. Place material handbooks (PDFs) in `IdeationLayer/paper/`
4. Run the system:
   ```bash
   cd IdeationLayer
   python alloy_recommendation_system.py
   ```

**Output:** Detailed alloy recommendations with supporting data from material handbooks.

### Simulation Layer Usage

Run predefined optimization cases:

```bash
cd SimulationLayer

# Ti-based alloys (yield strength / exp(density) optimization)
python AutoMAT_SimulationLayer.py --case case1 --iterations 5 --workers 5

# High-entropy alloys (yield strength optimization)
python AutoMAT_SimulationLayer.py --case case2 --iterations 5 --workers 5

# Custom scoring function
python AutoMAT_SimulationLayer.py --case own_case --iterations 5 --workers 5
```

**Output:** Optimized compositions with thermodynamic and mechanical properties.

## Key Achievements
